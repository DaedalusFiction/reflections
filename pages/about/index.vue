                    David Sorensen is a web developer based in Carlsbad,
                    Calfornia.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Originally from Charlottesville, Virginia, David attended
                    Eastern Mennonite University in Harrisonburg, VA, where he
                    studied Liberal Arts with a concentration in Bible and
                    Religion. He served as the News Editor for the University's
                    newspaper, <em>The Weather Vane</em>, where he furthered his
                    passion for writing and editing.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    In the years that followed, David took on freelance work as
                    a developmental and line editor for novels, mostly for
                    self-publishing authors. It wasn't until 2019 when he
                    decided he needed a new website for his business and,
                    drawing on the mindset of frugality he had internalized
                    during his time at EMU, decided to just go ahead and make
                    one himself.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Not wanting to use a website builder like Wordpress, he
                    figured it couldn't be too hard to learn basic enough HTMl
                    and CSS to build a simple site for his business. What he
                    didn't figure was that by the end of his project, he would
                    be so in love with coding that editing for fiction was to
                    him a thing of the past. Websites, as they say, were the
                    future.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    And so he finds himself making this new website, the latest
                    in a series of personal portfolios, each one arguably better
                    than the last. And so, too, do you find yourself reading his
                    bio and thinking to yourself, "Hmm, you know, I really ought
                    to hire this young fellow. He seems quite keen."
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    When he isn't designing, coding, or deploying a website,
                    Dave can be found reading his poetry at open-mic events,
                    playing board games with friends, or cooking a delicious
                    vegetarian meal, probably involving quinoa.
